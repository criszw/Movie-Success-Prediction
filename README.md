## Is there a secret recipe for the success of a movie?

I will be exploring different components of movies throughout the span of several decades, and hopefully develope a model that will predict reasonably accurate box-office results. 

The end result will be available to the public, as a tool allowing users to input their desired upcoming film and receiving their respective predictions.
